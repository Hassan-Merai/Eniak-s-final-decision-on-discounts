# Eniak-s-final-decision-on-discounts

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of discount pricing on product sales and revenue for Eniac. The goal is to determine whether product discounts are beneficial and to identify the best discount strategies for maximizing revenue while maintaining brand positioning.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Best-Selling Brands & Products:** Identified the most popular brands and their revenue contributions.
- **Impact of Discounts on Sales:** Analyzed the correlation between discount percentages and sales volume.
- **Optimal Discount Range:** Found that discounts between **20% and 35%** yield the best sales performance.
- **Strategic Discounting:** Recommended selective discounting instead of widespread price cuts.
- **Revenue vs. Expected Revenue:** Compared actual revenue with expected earnings to assess discount effectiveness.

## 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization
The project uses Python and Seaborn for data visualization to uncover trends, anomalies, and insights in discount pricing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Data Processing & Analysis)
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Exploratory Data Analysis)

## 📈 Key Findings & Recommendations
1. Discounts are essential for clearing outdated stock but should be **strategically applied**.
2. Discounts should **not exceed 35-40%**, as deeper cuts reduce profitability.
3. Promotions should be **seasonal** rather than continuous throughout the year.
4. The company should focus on **quality segments**, particularly high-revenue brands like Apple.
5. Further analysis is needed to measure the **exact impact on net profit**.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Conduct profit margin analysis alongside revenue trends.
- Improve forecasting models for better discount timing.
- Incorporate customer behavior insights into pricing strategies.
